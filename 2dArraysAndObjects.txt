1. Display "John" by extracting information from the person object

var person = { 
	firstName: "John", 
	lastName: "Doe"
};

2. Use a for...in loop to display the values of this object.

var bear = {
	firstName: "Grizzly", 
	lastName: "Bear", 
	age: 9,
	height: "5 cm",
	favoriteFood: "marshmallows"
};

3. Access the object in the previous question to display "Grizzly Bear loves marshmallows" as a string concatenation.
